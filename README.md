# Nanopore-Sequencing
Cas9/12a Madiated Target Enrichment for Nanopore Sequencing

# The aim of the project 
The aim of the project is to develop library preparation and sequencing methods compatible with third generation sequencing technologies which can be used to determine the number of repeats that cause neurodevelopmental diseases and the higher resolution of structural variants.
